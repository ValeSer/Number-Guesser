# Number-Guesser

In this project, you’ll write JavaScript functions to power a small guessing game. Your code will run in the browser instead of the terminal, and you can use your browser’s console to help you test your functions and view any syntax errors.
In this project, you’ll write four functions in script.js. We’ve provided some additional JavaScript code in game.js that will call your functions based on user interactions, but you don’t need to look at game.js and shouldn’t edit it if you want your project to work as intended. As you complete this project, make sure that all of your functions are named exactly as specified within these tasks so that they can be called correctly when the game is played. In this project, your JavaScript functions are incorporated into a website that also uses HTML/CSS.
